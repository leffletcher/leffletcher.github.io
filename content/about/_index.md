I am a fourth year student at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in NLP][1] at the University of Edinburgh, researching the **interaction between language evolution and neurodivergent language users** (with a focus on autistic people). I am a member of Edinburgh's [Centre for Language Evolution][4]. I am supervised by [Jennifer Culbertson][2] and [Hugh Rabagliati][3]. I am an autistic autism researcher .
