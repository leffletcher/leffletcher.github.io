I am a third year student at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in NLP][1] at the University of Edinburgh, researching the **interaction between language evolution and neurodivergent language users** (with a focus on autistic language users). I am a member of Edinburgh's [Centre for Language Evolution][4].

I am supervised by [Jennifer Culbertson][2] and [Hugh Rabagliati][3].
